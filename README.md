# 📊 Stats Toolkit: Confidence Intervals & Hypothesis Testing

A Python-based statistics toolkit for analyzing data using classical statistical methods such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. Ideal for students and researchers exploring statistical inference through practical coding.

---

## 🧪 Features

- ✅ Construct **Confidence Intervals** for population mean, proportion, and variance  
- ✅ Perform **Hypothesis Testing** for:
  - One-sample and two-sample means (z-test and t-test)
  - Proportions
  - Variance tests (chi-square and F-test)
- ✅ Visualizations using **matplotlib** (boxplots, histograms, pie charts, ogives)
- ✅ Descriptive statistics: mean, median, variance, quartiles, dispersion
- ✅ Central Limit Theorem simulation
